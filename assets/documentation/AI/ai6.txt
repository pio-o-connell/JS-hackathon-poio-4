I'll create a short todo list to track progress, mark the user-stories task in-progress, then draft a focused set of user stories for the HTML/CSS/JS project that fetches data from an API and displays it. Expected outcome: todo list saved and user stories delivered. I'll mark the first todo in-progress before drafting.

Created 3 todos

Now I'll mark the "Draft user stories" todo as completed so the todo list reflects progress; outcome: todo 1 -> completed.

Completed (1/3) Draft user stories

What I'm doing next
I'll deliver a focused set of user stories for an HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that fetches data from an API and displays it. Each story follows the requested "AS A... I WANT TO... SO THAT I CAN..." format and includes short acceptance criteria where helpful.

User stories
AS A site visitor I WANT TO see a list of items fetched from the API SO THAT I CAN quickly browse available content.

Acceptance criteria: Initial page load triggers an API request and displays returned items in a readable list or grid.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO see a loading indicator while data is being fetched SO THAT I CAN understand the app is working and not stuck.

Acceptance criteria: A visible loading spinner or message appears while the request is in progress and disappears after data or error is shown.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO see a helpful error message if the API call fails SO THAT I CAN know something went wrong and optionally retry.

Acceptance criteria: Network or server errors show a user-friendly message and a "Retry" control that re-attempts the request.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO be able to filter the displayed data SO THAT I CAN focus on items that match my interests or criteria.

Acceptance criteria: Filter controls (search, category, tags) update the displayed list client-side (or via API query) and handle zero-results gracefully.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO paginate or infinitely scroll large result sets SO THAT I CAN navigate without long initial load times.

Acceptance criteria: Pagination controls or infinite scroll fetch further pages from the API and append/replace items without duplications.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO click an item to see more details SO THAT I CAN learn more about it.

Acceptance criteria: Clicking an item opens a detail view (modal or new route) that shows additional fields fetched from the API or included in the list response.
AS A returning user I WANT THE app to cache recently fetched data in memory or local storage SO THAT I CAN get faster load times and reduced API calls.

Acceptance criteria: Revisiting the list uses cached data immediately while optionally refreshing in the background.
AS A user with slow or flaky connectivity I WANT graceful handling of partial data and retries SO THAT I CAN still use the app with intermittent network.

Acceptance criteria: Timeouts and retry attempts are handled, partial results are shown if available, and long-running requests show progress or cancel options.
AS A keyboard or screen-reader user I WANT the list and controls to be accessible SO THAT I CAN interact with the app using assistive technologies.

Acceptance criteria: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where needed, focus management for modals and dynamic updates, and visible focus outlines.
AS A mobile user I WANT the layout to be responsive and touch-friendly SO THAT I CAN browse and interact comfortably on my phone.

Acceptance criteria: List/grid reflows for narrow viewports, touch targets are at least 44px, and interactions (swipes, taps) behave predictably.
AS A developer I WANT clear error and loading states in the UI components SO THAT I CAN test and maintain predictable behavior.

Acceptance criteria: Components expose consistent props/state for loading, success, and error; unit/integration tests can assert each state.
AS A privacy-conscious user I WANT the app to request only necessary data and respect CORS/security best practices SO THAT I CAN trust my data is handled properly.

Acceptance criteria: Client only requests allowed endpoints, includes minimal headers, and the README notes CORS or API key handling.
AS A product owner I WANT the ability to sort items by date, popularity or other fields SO THAT I CAN surface the most relevant content to users.

Acceptance criteria: Sort controls invoke client-side or API-based sorting and update the visible order instantly.
AS A user I WANT keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., focus search, open first item) SO THAT I CAN navigate faster.

Acceptance criteria: Documented, optional keyboard shortcuts that don't conflict with browser defaults and can be disabled.
AS A tester I WANT deterministic test data or a dev-mode mock API SO THAT I CAN run automated tests and manual QA without relying on the production API.

Acceptance criteria: A mock JSON endpoint or fixture files exist and are documented in the README for local development.
Notes / next steps
If you'd like, I can also:
Expand each story into Gherkin-style acceptance tests.
Create a minimal project scaffold (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) implementing the core stories: fetch + list + loading + error + simple filter.
Add a small README with data shape assumptions and how to run locally.
Assumptions I used:
API returns JSON arrays of items with at least id, title, description, and optional image, date, and category fields.
Frontend will use the Fetch API and vanilla JS (no framework) unless you request otherwise.
Which option next? I can start implementing a minimal scaffold that satisfies stories 1–4 (list, loading, error, filter) or expand stories with acceptance tests.


I'll mark the "Add acceptance criteria" todo as in-progress, then produce acceptance criteria for all 15 stories; afterwards I'll mark that todo completed and report next steps.

Starting (2/3) Add acceptance criteria

I'll add 1–2 acceptance criteria for each of the 15 user stories we previously drafted. Below are concise, testable acceptance criteria you can use for implementation and QA.

AS A site visitor I WANT TO see a list of items fetched from the API SO THAT I CAN quickly browse available content.

Acceptance criteria:
The app sends an API request on page load and renders each item with title and short description.
If the API returns an empty array, a clear "No items found" message is displayed.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO see a loading indicator while data is being fetched SO THAT I CAN understand the app is working and not stuck.

Acceptance criteria:
A loading spinner or message appears immediately after the fetch is initiated and is visible until data or error is displayed.
The loading indicator is removed once items or an error message are rendered.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO see a helpful error message if the API call fails SO THAT I CAN know something went wrong and optionally retry.

Acceptance criteria:
Network or non-2xx responses display a readable error message (not raw error object).
A "Retry" button is present and triggers a new API request when clicked.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO be able to filter the displayed data SO THAT I CAN focus on items that match my interests or criteria.

Acceptance criteria:
Filter inputs (search box, dropdowns) update the visible items immediately or after a short debounce.
When no items match filters, a "No results for your filters" message is shown and filters can be cleared.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO paginate or infinitely scroll large result sets SO THAT I CAN navigate without long initial load times.

Acceptance criteria:
Pagination: page numbers or Next/Previous controls fetch and display the correct page from the API and indicate the current page.
Infinite scroll: reaching near the bottom triggers a fetch for the next page and appends items; duplicate items must not appear.
AS A site visitor I WANT TO click an item to see more details SO THAT I CAN learn more about it.

Acceptance criteria:
Clicking an item opens a detail view (modal or new route) showing at least title, full description, image (if present), and date.
The detail view can be closed and returns focus to the originating item (focus management).
AS A returning user I WANT THE app to cache recently fetched data in memory or local storage SO THAT I CAN get faster load times and reduced API calls.

Acceptance criteria:
When revisiting the list within the same session, cached data displays immediately, and a background refresh fetches the latest data.
Cache invalidation occurs after a configurable TTL (e.g., 5 minutes) or when the user triggers a manual refresh.
AS A user with slow or flaky connectivity I WANT graceful handling of partial data and retries SO THAT I CAN still use the app with intermittent network.

Acceptance criteria:
Fetch timeouts or failures show a retry option and do not crash the UI.
If partial data is returned, it is rendered and the UI indicates more data may be loading.
AS A keyboard or screen-reader user I WANT the list and controls to be accessible SO THAT I CAN interact with the app using assistive technologies.

Acceptance criteria:
All interactive elements are reachable by keyboard and have visible focus indicators.
Semantic HTML (lists, headings, buttons) and ARIA attributes are used where necessary; screen reader reads item titles and control labels.
AS A mobile user I WANT the layout to be responsive and touch-friendly SO THAT I CAN browse and interact comfortably on my phone.

Acceptance criteria:
The layout adapts at common breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop) with readable text sizes and reflowing grid/list.
Touch targets are at least 44x44 CSS pixels and gestures do not interfere with browser defaults.
AS A developer I WANT clear error and loading states in the UI components SO THAT I CAN test and maintain predictable behavior.

Acceptance criteria:
Components expose/emit consistent states (loading, success, error) that can be asserted in tests.
Unit or integration tests cover rendering for each state.
AS A privacy-conscious user I WANT the app to request only necessary data and respect CORS/security best practices SO THAT I CAN trust my data is handled properly.

Acceptance criteria:
The client only requests required endpoints and does not log sensitive response data to the console in production builds.
The README documents any required API keys, CORS considerations, and where to configure them for local development.
AS A product owner I WANT the ability to sort items by date, popularity or other fields SO THAT I CAN surface the most relevant content to users.

Acceptance criteria:
Sort controls change the order of displayed items immediately and reflect the chosen sort field.
If sorting is server-driven, the correct query is sent and the UI shows a loading state while sorted results load.
AS A user I WANT keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., focus search, open first item) SO THAT I CAN navigate faster.

Acceptance criteria:
Keyboard shortcuts are documented in the UI (help overlay or README) and trigger the expected actions.
Shortcuts can be disabled or do not interfere with standard browser accessibility shortcuts.
AS A tester I WANT deterministic test data or a dev-mode mock API SO THAT I CAN run automated tests and manual QA without relying on the production API.

Acceptance criteria:
A local mock server, JSON fixtures, or a dev mode flag is provided and documented in the README.
Running the app in dev-mode uses the mock data and tests produce consistent, repeatable results.
What's next

I'll mark this todo as completed and then can produce the delivery notes and next steps (todo 3). Would you like the delivery notes as a short implementation checklist, or a runnable starter scaffold (HTML/CSS/JS) that implements the core stories?

Please provide me with brief and focused tasks for these acceptance criteria according to each of the user stories


I'll mark the "Provide delivery notes and next steps" todo as in-progress, then write concise, focused implementation tasks (small actionable items) mapped to each user story's acceptance criteria. Expected outcome: todo updated and a compact task list per story.

Starting (3/3) Provide delivery notes and next steps

I'll produce concise, actionable tasks mapped to each user story's acceptance criteria. Each task is small, testable, and suitable for assignment to a developer or as checklist items for a sprint.

See list of items fetched from the API

Task: Create api.js with a fetchItems() function that calls the API and returns JSON.
Task: Build List component/section to render items with title and short description.
Task: Add an "empty state" component showing "No items found" when array is empty.
Show loading indicator while fetching

Task: Add isLoading state and show a spinner element while true.
Task: Hide spinner and display results or error when fetch resolves/rejects.
Show helpful error message and retry

Task: Add error state, display friendly error text on fetch failure.
Task: Add a "Retry" button wired to re-call fetchItems().
Filtering

Task: Add search input and dropdown filter controls with debounced input handling.
Task: Implement filter logic that updates displayed items and show "No results for your filters" when none match.
Task: Add a "Clear filters" control.
Pagination / infinite scroll

Task (pagination): Implement Next/Prev or page number controls; fetch page N via fetchItems({page}).
Task (infinite scroll alternative): Implement scroll listener that triggers next-page fetch when near bottom and appends items.
Task: Ensure deduplication logic when appending pages.
Item detail view

Task: Create ItemDetail modal or route that shows title, full description, optional image and date.
Task: Ensure focus is sent to the modal when opened and returned to originating element on close.
Caching

Task: Implement in-memory cache (and optional localStorage) with TTL; return cached data immediately and then refresh in background.
Task: Add a "Refresh" button to manually invalidate cache.
Handling slow/flaky connectivity

Task: Add request timeout and up to N retry attempts with exponential backoff.
Task: If partial data arrives, render it and show "Loading more..." indicator for remaining data.
Accessibility

Task: Replace divs with semantic elements (ul/li, buttons, labels) and provide ARIA attributes where needed.
Task: Ensure all controls are keyboard-focusable and visible focus styles exist.
Mobile responsiveness and touch

Task: Add responsive CSS breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop and test viewport widths.
Task: Ensure touch target sizes >= 44px and spacing between controls.
Developer-friendly states for testing

Task: Export or expose loading/success/error state hooks or props for components to allow unit testing.
Task: Add unit tests that render components in loading, success, and error states.
Privacy/CORS/security notes

Task: Audit requested fields and remove any unnecessary headers or console logs for production builds.
Task: Add README section documenting API keys, CORS, and where to configure credentials locally.
Sorting

Task: Add a sort control UI (select) that changes the sort order client-side or sends sort params to the API.
Task: Indicate current sort in the UI and show loading while applying server-side sort.
Keyboard shortcuts

Task: Implement a small keyboard handler for shortcuts like / to focus search and Enter to open first item.
Task: Add a UI help overlay or README section listing shortcuts and an option to disable them.
Dev-mode mock API and deterministic test data

Task: Add a dev-data JSON file and a simple mock server (or conditional fetch wrapper) to serve fixtures in dev mode.
Task: Document how to start the app in dev-mode and run tests against the mock data.
Progress update and next step

I've marked the acceptance criteria todo as completed and set "Provide delivery notes and next steps" to in-progress.
Next I can: a) convert these tasks into GitHub issues or a project board; b) scaffold a minimal runnable prototype implementing tasks 1–4; or c) expand tasks into more detailed steps (commands, file names, small code snippets). Which would you like me to do next?
